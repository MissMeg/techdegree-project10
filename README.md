Because of the recent Node update, there have been some issues with sequelize that have not been resolved yet. If you run into troubles after installing (npm install) then do a rebuild (npm rebuild) and that should help. Also, after closing the program, make sure to check your task manager and close any leftover Node tasks that are still running. Otherwise, your port 3000 will still be in use.
